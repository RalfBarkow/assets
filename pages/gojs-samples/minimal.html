  <!-- The DIV for the Diagram needs an explicit size or else we won't see anything.
       This also adds a border to help see the edges of the viewport. -->

  <p>
    This isn't a truly <i>minimal</i> demonstration of <b>GoJS</b>,
    because we do specify a custom Node template and turn on undo/redo support, but it's pretty simple.
    The whole source for the sample is shown below if you click on the link.
  </p>
  <p>
      This sample sets the <a>Diagram.nodeTemplate</a>, with a <a>Node</a> template that data binds both the text string and the shape's fill color.
      For an overview of building your own templates and model data, see the <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/blob/e19b773104cf34f9aff6873b57cd3187d038719c/learn/index.html">Getting Started tutorial.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the mouse and common keyboard commands, you can pan, select, move, copy, delete, undo, and redo.
    On touch devices, use your finger to act as the mouse, and press and hold your finger stationary to bring up a context menu.
    The default context menu supports most of the standard commands that are enabled at that time for the selected object.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a more elaborate sample, supporting grouping and tooltips and custom context menus,
    see the <a href="basic.html">Basic</a> sample.

<script id="code">
 const myDiagram =
     new go.Diagram("myDiagramDiv",  // create a Diagram for the HTML Div element
                    { "undoManager.isEnabled": true });  // enable undo & redo

 // define a simple Node template
 myDiagram.nodeTemplate =
     new go.Node("Auto")  // the Shape will go around the TextBlock
           .add(new go.Shape("RoundedRectangle",
                             { strokeWidth: 0, fill: "white" })  // no border; default fill is white
                      .bind("fill", "color"))  // Shape.fill is bound to Node.data.color
           .add(new go.TextBlock(
               { margin: 8, font: "bold 14px sans-serif", stroke: '#333' })  // some room around the text
                      .bind("text", "key"));  // TextBlock.text is bound to Node.data.key

 // but use the default Link template, by not setting Diagram.linkTemplate

 // create the model data that will be represented by Nodes and Links
 myDiagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(
     [
         { key: "Alpha", color: "lightblue" },
         { key: "Beta", color: "orange" },
