Students completed pre- and post- Learner Identity Survey (LID) and mid and retro long-answer questionnaires.

The impact of the experience was found to have the most change to Learner Identity in terms of vulnerability, disposition and creativity.

don&rsquo;t like the fact that [school] is 7+ hours a day and takes about 12+ years to complete, only to receive more work at home. After Grade (sic) 12 you then go on to do 4 years + of more school only for you to receive a piece of paper that helps you to get an average wage 9&ndash;5 job. You then finish work, retire, then die and regret your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c48 c29"><span class="c0">A ninth/ tenth grade student</span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span>This</span><span>&nbsp;is not OK. It is not acceptable to me that a young person who, by today&rsquo;s standards, would be expected to live for another sixty years at least, has such a despairing view of life. Victor Frankl (1946)</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;in his book Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning, defines despair as </span><span>suffering without meaning.</span><span>&nbsp;In this simple summary statement about life, this young person is describing the essence of what I understand to be the root cause of the </span><span>widely reported mental health issues for teenagers</span><span>&nbsp;(WHO, 2021), various TikTok challenges to destroy schools (Klein, 2022)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>and the high levels of stress experienced by those working in education (Agyapong et al., 2022).</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>There is a sense that there is much suffering, little learning and no meaning-making within school communities (Walsh, 2020).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span class="c0">The statement was made by a student at the international school where the following study was conducted prior to launching the Designed inGenuity (DiG) learning framework. The students were asked, &ldquo;What do you love about school?&rdquo; and then, &ldquo;What do you dislike about school?&rdquo; These two questions provoked much animated discussion; revealing to the students and educators in the room the importance of relationships, the clarity of the students&rsquo; opinions and, for some educators, it caused a great deal of discomfort. </span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span>When the students were subsequently asked, &ldquo;If you could design a school, what would you want to happen?,&rdquo; most students focused on what they did not want&ndash;for example, uniforms, early starts and being told what to do all the time. This was a surprise to most adults in the room who had envisioned students sharing vivid images of how they would want their learning spaces to look, sound and feel, with a focus on particular subjects and more access to the outside world. Instead, the students&rsquo; responses demonstrated apathy, inertia and hopelessness; they did not believe anything would change even if they shared their ideas with the adults. These young people clearly expressed that they feel like they have no choice in how they live their lives, especially within the school setting. The lack of imagination for what might be possible in designing their own learning journeys and lives affirmed the need for change. </span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span class="c0">During this five-year journey of a Master&rsquo;s degree in Transformative Learning Communities, I have explored the meaning of these three concepts, experienced transformation within myself, observed the transformation of others and participated in learning within my community. Also during this time, I was introduced to the DiG learning framework. Since experiencing the transformative experience of a DiG learning journey with others, I have wondered how it might impact young people around the world. I believe that it is the responsibility of adults in schools to first transform themselves in order to create the conditions for young people to experience transformation. This is, after all, the aspiration of learning; that we are transformed because we have made meaning from the experiences in our lives. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h3 class="c7 c37" id="h.vc3xsgr7f17e"><span class="c24 c5"></span></h3><h2 class="c18" id="h.woscbyvtvdy7"><span class="c8">My Own Story</span></h2><p class="c12 c29 c38"><span>Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last </span><span>of the human</span><span>&nbsp;freedoms&mdash;to choose one&rsquo;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&rsquo;s own way</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c48 c29"><span class="c0">&ndash;Victor Frankl, Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning (1992, p. 3)</span></p><p class="c31 c65 c28 c5"><span class="c5">As an unseen young artist, who loved to create beauty through words, letters and still life sketches, I often wonder what my life might be like today if any of my teachers had asked me what I loved to see, do, or think about, how I was making meaning of these observations, experiences and ideas and what I was passionate about creating in the world. The young artist makes an appearance every now and then and in those moments there is a feeling that, perhaps, a gift has been denied to the world. I do not want anyone else to feel that they were not able to choose their own way. I want to live in a world where all of our natural talents are guided towards the fulfillment of our innate potential and &nbsp;we are able to purposefully contribute to a flourishing world. </span></p><p class="c31 c65 c28 c5"><span class="c5">Globally, school systems are oppressive and based on a philosophy of conformity, compliance and control. This statement is well documented and most famously described by the late Sir Ken Robinson in many of his talks, books and discussions about how schools kill creativity (Robinson, 2006)</span><span class="c5">.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Reflecting</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;on my own experiences after primary school, I &nbsp;agree with </span><span class="c5">Sir Robinson&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c5">assessment. I was expected to conform by following a straight line from school to college and then to university, and although I recognize the privilege of being born into a safe and loving family, this experience was not what I would have chosen for myself. After complying with the &ldquo;game of school,&rdquo; I discovered ways to learn with young people without the control of school through volunteering and mentoring opportunities. After a career in retail banking, I was invited to return to school as an educator. However, it quickly became clear to me that the education system was still limiting young people&rsquo;s creative potential. </span></p><p class="c31 c28 c5 c65"><span class="c5">The education that we receive in schools is creating the society that we live in and therefore it is essential that we have open discussions about the beliefs, theory and practices of school. </span><span class="c0 c5">I believe that each human being is born with an infinite capacity to learn and to deepen their thinking and that by learning with intention, we can transform ourselves, others and the world we are co-creating. Currently, I am working as a Global Education Coach with a mission of transforming education towards purpose-driven learning using the DiG learning framework. My focus has been on the education system around the world, including state schools, charter schools, private schools, faith-based schools, urban and rural schools, online learning platforms and other learning environments. </span></p><p class="c31 c65 c28 c5"><span>The guiding intention of the DiG learning framework is to &ldquo;awaken wonder&rdquo; so that empowered creative learners might become </span><span>creative problem solvers. </span><span>Since experiencing the DiG, I have observed a transformation within myself; my learner identity has improved. My confidence with learning, sharing my learning and supporting others to learn has increased. I recognize myself as a lifelong learner who is curious, courageous and able to make meaningful connections with concepts, ideas and others. T</span><span class="c5">hrough the experience of a DiG, I feel empowered to seek and create solutions to situations that we all face in our daily lives. I am curious about the impact of the DiG on others. </span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.2khxfuuzfvkk"><span>W</span><span>ho I Am in This Inquiry</span></h2><p class="c12 c28"><span class="c5">In this inquiry I am a researcher, facilitator and coach. I am curious about the possibility of reimagining education as an opportunity for us all to be deeply reconnected to what it means to be human. </span><span class="c0">We need a deeper understanding of the purpose of learning and its transformative effects on humans of all ages in order to co-create a world in which we can all flourish.</span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span class="c0">The current education system accepts the mediocrity of information gathering, knowledge-making and assessment of a final product. However, what is needed are learning environments intentionally curated for powerful learning experiences, opportunities for making meaning of those experiences and then purpose-driven learning that leads to the transformation of the individual, the community and the planet. Our young people are repeatedly demanding that we must change how we show up for them. I work to inspire educators, through modeling, facilitating and coaching, to move toward a new way of being. </span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span>Philosophically and practically, I am guiding adults and young people to view themselves as co-learners; encouraging them to remain curious and to courageously respond to changing realities with resilience, through experimentation and feedback. A fundamental part of the human condition is to be constantly learning and with </span><span class="c0 c5">global interest in the impact of the DiG on educators and students, this study is the first to formally research the neuroscience base of the work and the potential impact on learner identity. </span></p><p class="c12 c14"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.ugaopya2j7k6"><span>A Note on Language</span></h2><p class="c12 c28"><span class="c0">The language used in this thesis is placed in the context of a British-born citizen using American spelling to be consistent with the American spelling of the international school in Ethiopia and the university assessing the thesis. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The language used in this thesis is reflective of my preference of referring to</span><span>&nbsp;teachers</span><span>&nbsp;as educators. The root of the two words is different and implies different attitudes, behaviors and notions of learning. The word &ldquo;teach&rdquo; has the root </span><span>&ldquo;to show,&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;which implies that the student plays a passive role in the relationship (Harper). The word &ldquo;educator,&rdquo; on the other hand, is drawn from the root word &ldquo;educare&rdquo;;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;to draw out</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Harper). This implies that the educator is intentionally creating the conditions for the learner to share what is already inside of them, as it relates to the new information given. The educator is engaged in a systemic feedback loop in which they can learn from the student as they share their insights. This is a mutually beneficial relationship. The word student is used as it is a more familiar concept than &lsquo;young learner.&rsquo;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.g1t04rjvovi"><span>M</span><span>otivations for Undertaking This Study</span></h2><p class="c6"><span>&ldquo;I would like school to teach us things we will actually use in our life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c29 c57"><span class="c0">A ninth/ tenth grade student</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">This study of the impact of the DiG learning framework on a Personalized Learning Experience (PLEx) program was inspired by the desire of the Lead Facilitator to create the possibility for deeper learning. She had joined the international school in Ethiopia in the 2022-2023 academic year and was assigned to organize, lead and facilitate PLEx; a legacy project from a previous head of school. PLEx is a four-week, off-regular schedule and end-of-school-year program for ninth and tenth grade students. The school wanted to determine if they would continue arranging this experience at the end of the school year or move to integrating a PLEx culture throughout the school year. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>In a desire to create a more personalized experience, the Lead Facilitator gathered </span><span>a small committee of students to discuss what PLEx 2023 might look like, sound like and feel like. They provided input on the schedule for the four weeks including organizing physical activities and weekly breakfast gatherings.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;They suggested that students could be asked to share initial ideas of what they would like to produce at the end of the four weeks. As this information from the students was received, the Lead Facilitator began to wonder about the depth of the learning. Would the students have a transformative experience in which they make personal meaning and find a collective purpose?</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The PLEx Lead Facilitator</span><span>&nbsp;wanted to see students demonstrate a deeper understanding of the purpose of their project and who their project could impact. She wanted the experience to inspire them to become lifelong learners who are passionate about transforming the world. She wanted them to experience a transformative learning experience within their school and local community. Knowing that Transformative Learning Communities is the name of my </span><span>Master of Arts i</span><span class="c0">n Social Sciences specialization, she asked if I could support her to undertake the work of organizing, leading and facilitating the work. Our discussions led us to realize she was looking to improve the students&rsquo; learner identity and this was an opportunity to research the impact of the DiG learning framework on students. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">We met with the high school principal to discuss how this might be done. It was agreed that I would first lead eight educators, plus the principal and assistant principal, through an online personal learning journey using the DiG learning framework. Then I would come to Ethiopia for one week to launch the experience with the students using the DiG learning framework. Finally, I would provide online support to the Lead Facilitator for the following three weeks as she and the other educators continued to facilitate and guide the students towards a transformative learning experience within their community. </span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.fo448gy8m176"><span>Research Question and </span><span>Purpose Statement</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>The research question for this study is, &ldquo;</span><span>What is the impact of the Designed inGenuity (DiG) learning framework on ninth and tenth grade students&rsquo; learner identity in an international school in Ethiopia?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The DiG process guides students through a process of creating personal meaning when learning about their own interests.

The general field of this study is transformative learning within communities. There has been much interest in the impact of transformative learning (Mezirow, 1991) and personalized learning (Walkington &amp; Bernacki, 2020) within recent years. This literature review will describe and define these concepts. In addition, this review will share the major developments in neuroscience research with the advancement of technology, particularly fMRIs (Ogawa, 1990). It will define and describe the three main tenets of the DiG learning framework: curiosity, courage and connection. Finally, it will discuss the concept of </span><span>learner identity (Kolb &amp; Kolb, 2009)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with a short review of each of the characteristics measured by the Learner Identity (LID) survey. </span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.197ocuneyk6j"><span class="c8">Personalized Learning </span></h2><p class="c1 c38"><span>Education doesn&rsquo;t need to be reformed&mdash;it needs to be transformed. The key is not to standardize education, but to personalize it, to build achievement on discovering the talents of each child, to put students in an environment where they want to learn and where they can naturally discover their true passions</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Robinson &amp; Aronica, 2009, p. 238)</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The current thinking about the definition</span><span>&nbsp;of personalized learning (PL) is that there is no one definition. Rather it is often described as a reference to </span><span>practices that tailor the pace and focus of instruction to address the needs and goals of each stu</span><span>dent. </span><span>(Pane et al., 2017). The </span><span>U.S. Department of Education, </span><span class="c0">writing in the context of the impact of technology on learning in schools, make it clear that PL means understanding the needs of each individual learner and varying all elements of the learning to their needs:</span></p><p class="c1 c38"><span>Personalized learning refers to instruction in which the pace of learning and the instructional approach are optimized for the needs of each learner&hellip;. In addition, learning activities are meaningful and relevant to learners, driven by their interests, and often self-initiated. (2017, p. 9)</span></p><p class="c12 c14"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>In this information age, it has been identified that the availability of highly customized information allows people to tailor their exposure to the amount and type of information by their own preferences (Liang et al., 2006</span><span>). </span><span>In the same way, to avoid information overload for learners, educators can create space for students to personalize their learning. Many studies on personalized learning have been curious about the effects of using advanced technologies to personalize student learning (Arroyo et al., 2014; Chen, 2008; Robinson &amp; Sebba, 2010). However, &ldquo;While positive effects of technology-supported personalized learning approaches on educational outcomes have been often proposed from a theoretical perspective, empirical evidence is still in its infancy&rdquo; (Schmid et al., 2022, p. 189</span><span>). </span><span class="c0">Lee et al. (2018) argue that to personalize instruction and to document the individual learning progress, technology is essential. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The research on personalized learning consistently refers to the process as students setting their own goals and path. The </span><span>Aurora Institute</span><span>, a non-profit organization whose mission is to drive the transformation of education systems, explains, &ldquo;In a personalized learning environment, learners have agency to set their own goals for learning, create a reflective process during their journey to attain those goals, and be flexible enough to take their learning outside the confines of the traditional classroom.&rdquo; (Patrick et al., 2013, p. 4). Bray and McClaskey (2014), international speakers on personalized learning, explain that in PL, &ldquo;learners have a choice in how they demonstrate what they know and provide evidence of their learning. In a learner-centered environment, learners own and co-design their learning. The teacher is their guide on their personal journ</span><span>ey&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>(</span><span>p. 5)</span><span class="c0">. This point also highlights the importance of the students determining their own style of presentation to share their learning journey.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The role of the educator is emphasized in much of the literature. Dougherty (2021) explains, &ldquo;Building student ownership of learning requires positive relationships with students. Teachers who know and care about their students as individuals are best able to personalize learning that builds ownership of l</span><span>earning</span><span>&rdquo; </span><span>(para. 5).</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>However, according to Shemshack and Spector (2020)</span><span>: </span></p><p class="c1 c38"><span>It seems the personalized learning models gain more attention from governments and policymakers than educators and researchers. We need to focus on the obstacles of lack of interest to motivate the educators and researchers, the experts of the field, to voice their concerns and look for solutions to come up with a robust model that will satisfy both instructor and learners&rsquo; expectations. </span><span>(p. 16)</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The impact of personalized learning on students&rsquo; learning outcomes has had mixed results (Walkington &amp; Bernacki, 2020). Schmid et al. (2022) share that two meta-analyses studies showed that student-centered approaches are associated with an increase in cognitive and emotional-social aspects of learning in comparison to traditional approaches (Cornelius-White, 2007; Freeman et al., 2014). A study of eighth-grade students in Ohio revealed the impact of PL on student enjoyment: &ldquo;When using a student-driven, connected approach, students stated that they enjoyed the connectedness of their learning&ndash;across disciplines, through technology, and through relationships with each other and their teachers&rdquo; (Porath &amp; Hagerman,</span><span>&nbsp;2021, p. 36). </span><span>However, the evidence of the impact of PL is currently inconclusive and inconsistent, in line with the lack of a widely accepted definition of personalized learning. </span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.m4f9pbceokyn"><span class="c8">Transformative Learning</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The aspiration of the DiG is to co-create the conditions for transformative learning with an emphasis on connecting the abstract concepts in many curricula to the learner&rsquo;s lived experiences and own curiosities leading to personal meaning. Rooted in the work of Jack Mezirow, transformative learning (TL) is a comprehensive educational theory that explores the process through which individuals undergo significant shifts in their perspectives, beliefs, and identities. It is grounded in constructivist and critical theory perspectives (Mezirow, 1991). His theory highlights the importance of reflection, critical discourse, and a disorienting dilemma as catalysts for transformative learning (Cranton, 2006).</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Mezirow (1994) has defined transformative learning as &ldquo;an orientation which holds that the way learners interpret and reinterpret their sense experience is central to making meaning and hence learnin</span><span>g&rdquo; (p. 222).</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Although his research is grounded in adult education and learning, recognizing adults&rsquo; life experiences as valuable learning resources, it is possible to apply his understanding to young people&rsquo;s learning experiences. He originally proposed a ten-phase process, including a disorienting dilemma, self-examination, critical assessment, and the acquisition of new perspectives. &nbsp;However, later scholars refined these stages, emphasizing the cyclical and recursive nature of transformative learning (Taylor, 2007). Transformative learning is increasingly recognized in higher education as having the impact of fostering critical thinking, social awareness, and personal development (Kitchenham, 2008).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Transformative learning is often facilitated through reflective practices, encouraging individuals to question assumptions and consider alternative viewpoints (Cranton, 2006). The process of a dialogical interaction in which people are engaging in meaningful discourse with others, especially those with diverse perspectives, enhances the transformative learning process (Mezirow, 2000). However, individuals may resist transformative learning due to a discomfort with challenging their existing beliefs (Mezirow, 1991). In addition, institutional barriers, such as scheduling and education policies may pose challenges to the implementation of transformative learning approaches (Taylor, 2017).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Transformative learning is closely linked to social justice, encouraging individuals to critically examine social issues and work toward positive change (Cranton, 2006). Integrating social justice principles into transformative learning practices enhances its impact on societal transformation (Dirkx, 2012). Studies by Gregor&#269;i&#269; and Jelenc Kra&scaron;ovec (2017) and Gregor&#269;i&#269; (2019) have even explored the impact of TL on politics and economics in society. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>As with PL, the impact of technology on TL is still being researched. Professor Emeritus of Lifelong Learning and Adult Education at Penn State University, Dr </span><span>Taylor</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(2017) states that digital platforms and online learning environments can provide opportunities for transformative learning experiences. The possibility of global collaboration and diverse perspectives through technology-mediated dialogues and reflective blogging are examples of how online spaces can facilitate transformative learning (Rodgers, 2002). As technology continues to shape learning environments, there are further opportunities to foster transformative learning experiences, promoting critical consciousness, and societal change.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Although Mezirow&rsquo;s research began in adult learning, TL has its roots in critical and constructivist theories and evolved into a multifaceted educational approach applicable across various contexts. Understanding the challenges and opportunities associated with TL is essential for educators and researchers aiming to harness its potential for personal and societal transformation. The DiG holds the possibility of a transformative learning experience for all participants. </span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.yolq4v8jvsps"><span class="c8">How We Learn</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>One of the leading models of how we learn is based on the groundbreaking work of Karl Friston, an important contributor in the development of modern neuroscience. It was with his algorithms of statistical parametric mapping that we began to unlock the potential of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRIs) to see the mind in the act of thinking. This ability has completely transformed how we understand the brain &ndash; leading to a deeper appreciation of the whole mind; &ldquo;a whole-brain network associated with high-creative ability </span><span>comprised</span><span>&nbsp;of cortical hubs within default, salience, and executive systems&rdquo; (Beaty et al</span><span>., 2018, p. 1087).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Friston et al. (2017) developed a process theory called &ldquo;active inference&rdquo; to explain how all living things learn. At the core of this theory was his concept of the &ldquo;free energy principle&rdquo; or the &ldquo;normalizing force.&rdquo; Using the example of physics: assuming that particles naturally exist in a chaotic state, leads to the existence of a normalizing force that creates some order. Likewise from Friston&rsquo;s process theory, we understand that biological systems have their own systems, their own normalizing force, to maintain order. They do this by restricting themselves to a limited number of states which entail beliefs about hidden states in their environment. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>At the core of Friston&#39;s work is something called Bayesian inference, in which Bayes&rsquo; rule, a statistical formula, is applied. This statistical method is focused on how one might best predict future experiences based on current knowledge.</span><span>&nbsp;According to </span><span>Bayes&#39; rule</span><span class="c0">, the optimal way of using this information is to calculate the information&#39;s likelihood under various models of the environment, and to weight this likelihood by the strength of prior belief in each model to derive posterior beliefs. In recent years, the influential hypothesis has been advanced that Bayesian inference represents a unifying principle of neural computation (the Bayesian brain hypothesis; Knill and Pouget, 2004, as cited in Bennett, 2015).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In simple terms, learning begins with an assumption. We assume that the world is organized based on our previous experiences. This assumption allows us to act, because we assume that the consequences of that action will be predictable. The problem is that the world is far more complex than the mental model we will ever have of it. In turn, not all actions result in consequences that we have predicted. A central function of the nervous system is to use sensory information to infer the causal structure of the external world. When there is an unexpected experience, a &ldquo;surprise,&rdquo; order is disrupted and must be quickly restored. That experience of surprise is essential for our learning as it forces us to update our understanding of the world. To reestablish order, small, continuous experiments are used, something Friston calls &ldquo;epistemic foraging,&rdquo; until there is a moment that a new understanding, a new order, is established, what Friston calls a &ldquo;Bayesian belief update.&rdquo; These updates are informed by beliefs about the future (prediction) and context learning that is informed by beliefs about the past (postdiction) (Friston et al., 2017). </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Making this connection between what we thought we knew and what the new experience teaches us is the essence of lifelong learning. This theory closely aligns with </span><span>Piaget&rsquo;s theories of learning, specifically the concept of &ldquo;schematic accommodation.&rdquo; Piaget&rsquo;s philosophy of education, &ldquo;constructivism,&rdquo; </span><span>surmised that learners gradually build an increasing understanding of the world through the experience of learning (cited in Luvmour, 2006). This experience either added to their existing model of how the world worked, which he called their &ldquo;cognitive model,&rdquo; or caused them to restructure that model to create a new understanding. With this new understanding, we remain curious and courageously venture back out into the world. Only to be surprised again. Only to learn again. A lifelong process of learning that allows us to grow. A process that helps us gain new meaning that gives our life a purpose larger than ourselves (Morrison).</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.b9xo3gdsihvm"><span>Designed inGenuity Learning Framework (DiG)</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>The DiG is a learning framework for the cre</span><span>ative mind.</span><span>&nbsp;It is an approach that emerged from a partnership between a software industry consultant, Thompson Morrison, and Jami Fluke, a principal of a school in Dayton, Oregon. This partnership was inspired by the work of a seventh-grade classroom teacher named </span><span>Jenni Shilhanek.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Having been granted the permission to experiment from Jami, Jenni developed what was then called the Dayton Practice: fast, iterative learning cycles that help students find personal meaning in a way that exponentially accelerates the rate of their learning (Turner).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The DiG framework takes participants through a process of personalized learning with a DiG guide carefully guiding the group toward a transformative learning experience. The intention is to create an ambience of curiosity within the group; to awaken, or reawaken, wonder in the participants about the world around them and to make meaningful connections between new information and prior understanding. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Each DiG begins by determining a </span><span>common ground</span><span>, a place of convergence for the &ldquo;learning pod.&rdquo; The b</span><span>ase</span><span>, a two-word phrase that all participants connect with their learning, is pre-determined by the DiG guide. An example of a base is Empowered Genius. Each learner is then commissioned to embark on a journey that is divergent in nature. This is determined by the spin of the wheel to receive a &ldquo;scrambler&rdquo; word, and an invitation to connect the research to the learner&rsquo;s own interests and curiosities. T</span><span>he scramblers are concepts that can</span><span>&nbsp;include well-established subject disciplines (science, history, etc); defined concepts from the curriculum (for example, protection, freedom); as well as abstract concepts (for example, twenty-first century skills of curiosity and creativity). The learners gather at regular intervals to share their learning journey, connecting the </span><span>two-word base and scrambler</span><span>&nbsp;with their own interests and curiosities, with their &ldquo;Learning Pod.&rdquo; This </span><span>learning </span><span>trivium</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of a base, a scrambler and the learner&rsquo;s own curiosities and interests creates the potential for deep insight into their understandings of themselves, each other and the world. At the end of the learning sprint, their discoveries are brought back to the group in a &ldquo;Demo Day,&rdquo; where the pod members learn from each other and a new convergence of shared understanding is created. The Learning Pod returns to reflect on this shared understanding and the process as a whole, moving from a Learning Pod to a &ldquo;Creative Pod,&rdquo; and the learning process begins anew.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A key element of the DiG is the ritual of creating a brave and safe space together (convergence), individually exploring, discovering and making meaning (divergence) and then reconnecting with each other to deeply listen to each other&rsquo;s stories of learning. The DiG structure and routines provide a safe space for participants to share their learning with each other. This journey of exploration and discovery, guided by a curious deep listener asking simple questions about surprises and feelings, leads to personal insights and collective stories that make meaning of the learning experience. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The DiG process is based on the Agile framework; a structured set of practices, principles, and guidelines that organizations use to implement and apply Agile principles in their software development projects.</span><span>&nbsp;The </span><span>Agile method of learning</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is one in which a clear intention is defined, deciphered and then acted upon in fast, iterative learning cycles (L&oacute;pez-Alcarria, 2019). In this model, not only are both convergent and divergent thinking embraced, but also passive and active learning. This emergent pedagogy might be termed integrated learning&ndash;where thinking and learning are linked with curriculum and experiences in order to achieve rich and deep learning that unleashes the creative genius of students. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">There is a rhythm of learning that can be developed when DiGs are incorporated into conventional curriculum-based learning. In these classroom environments, direct instruction can be used to help establish a shared knowledge base, a &ldquo;scaffolding,&rdquo; for the learning which then leads into a DiG adventure where that knowledge is made alive and meaningful for students through their curiosity and creativity. This meaning increases student engagement and agency.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The DiG framework complements how digital natives, who are the students in our schools, are thinking differently from previous generations. While traditional education practices focus on the product (a report or an exam), the learning cycles of the DiG framework center on process. This approach recognizes that when the intention of learning has been defined, the product, a &ldquo;creative artifact,&rdquo; will emerge&ndash;and often it will both surprise and surpass expectations. The incorporation of both the divergent thinking required to &ldquo;empathize&rdquo; and &ldquo;ideate&rdquo; and the convergent thinking that precedes bringing the process to the creation of a product is one of the most powerful aspects of a DiG. It adds to the DiG being a more &ldquo;human-centered&rdquo; process that enables learner agency through its focus on personal meaning-making through the lens of the learner&rsquo;s own interests.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Since learning about the DiG, the researcher has observed Morrison take many educators through the process and participated in the DiG themselves.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Educators often share their surprise at the depth of insights that emerge when following their own curiosities. They also share surprise at their courage to share the insights with their colleagues, even those with whom they had a loose connection. Often, educators shared that they felt intimately connected to their peers and with the new learning about random, seemingly disconnected concepts in their stories at the end of the DiG. These observations led to the insight that the core tenets of the DiG are curiosity, courage and connection. </span></p><p class="c12 c14"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c30" id="h.7oy55j38ekuj"><span class="c24 c5">Tenet 1: Curiosity</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Curiosity, one of the key tenets of the DiG framework, is the first step toward new learning. There are many definitions of curiosity; a recent neuroscience study defined it this way: &ldquo;Curiosity is an internally motivated search for information.&rdquo; The same study adds that curiosity &ldquo;is enduring and open-ended, and may have evolved to help us build accurate mental representations of our ever-changing environments&rdquo; (Patankar et al., 2023, p. 2). &nbsp;Curiosity is identified as a &ldquo;motivator for learning, influential in decision-making, and crucial for healthy development&rdquo; (Kidd &amp; Hayden, 2015, p. 1). It is something that has been studied by psychologists and neuroscientists for over one hundred years. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Curiosity is considered to be &ldquo;critical for academic performance&rdquo; (Association for Psychological Science, 2011). Generally defined as a desire to learn or know about something, it is considered the first step toward learning in this study of the impact of the DiG. The DiG is a response to many scholars&rsquo; calls to schools and universities, which &ldquo;must early on encourage intellectual hunger and not exclusively reward the acquiescent application of intelligence and effort&rdquo; (Charlton, 2009, quoted in in Stumm et al., 2011, </span><span>p. 582</span><span class="c0">).</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Engel reminds us that we are naturally curious in the title of her book, T</span><span>he Hungry Mind: The Origins of Curiosity in Childhood</span><span>&nbsp;(2015). She argues that curiosity is intrinsic to children&#39;s development and that the educator has an important role to play in cultivating curiosity. Engel also reminds us that, &ldquo;Novelty is not everything&hellip;. Sometimes children are most eager to learn about something with which they are already familiar&rdquo; (2011, p. 627). Her article, &ldquo;</span><span>The Case for Curiosity</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; (Engel, 2013), shares four ways in which educators can support their students to become more curious and satisfy their hungry minds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Other definitions of curiosity include Piaget&rsquo;s definition, &ldquo;the urge to explain the unexpected&rdquo; (cited in Whitehouse et al, 2018). This resonates with the work of Friston explained above (in the How We Learn Section, page 26). Additionally, Kagan (cited in Whitehouse et al, 2018) described curiosity as the</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;need to resolve uncertainty</span><span>&rdquo; further reinforcing the reason for the importance of opening up space for curiosity in learning (p. 5). In agreement, Engel (cited in Whitehouse et al., 2018) states, &ldquo;When children are curious, they learn. It turns out that curiosity in school is not merely a nicety but a necessit</span><span>y.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(p. 6)</span></p><p class="c4"><span>However, Whitehouse et al (2018) ask the essential question, </span><span>&ldquo;Teachers may start their careers as professionals who develop, hone and instil skills such as awe, wonder and curiosity but how easy is this to maintain in a constantly shifting climate of change?&rdquo; </span><span>(p. 3). They emphasize the importance of educators showing up as curious learners with their students. They state, &ldquo;Curiosity then is perhaps something that needs to be taught, encouraged and developed, in teachers as well as in the children they teach&rdquo; </span><span>(</span><span>p. 3</span><span class="c0">). </span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.xjx9aontm0yt"><span class="c24 c5">Tenet 2: Courage</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Although there is a recognition of the need for courage in classrooms, it has not yet been widely studied and has no one clear definition (Martin, 2011). In their book, Character Strengths and Virtues, Peterson and Seligman (2004) name courage as one of the strengths of character. It is considered to be a foundational, cross-cultural human virtue associated with key character strengths like bravery, persistence, and integrity. This tenet of the DiG is associated with confidence, vulnerability and resilience. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>In the title of his book, </span><span>The Courage to Teach, P</span><span>arker Palmer </span><span>(2017)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;reminds us of the origin of the word from the French &ldquo;coeur&rdquo; for heart. The book details what it means to have the heart of an educator: &ldquo;good teaching cannot be reduced to good technique; good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher&rdquo; (p. 10). Palmer explains that it is essential for the educator to be brave enough to explore their own sense of self, be willing to vulnerably share themselves with their students and be adaptable in their practice. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Bren&eacute; Brow</span><span>n (2018), </span><span>wide</span><span>ly recognized as one of the most influential researchers of vulnerability,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;explains that &ldquo;we must find the courage to get curious and possibly surface emotions and emotional experiences&rdquo; (p. 67). She shares the importance of parents and educators being vulnerable and brave, particularly because they are often the leaders in the relationship. The theme of knowing oneself is reinforced in her work as she calls on everyone to have the confidence to accept the challenge of being vulnerable with others and face the consequences of doing so. </span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.lnbx5cspfg7t"><span class="c24 c5">Tenet 3: Connection</span></h3><p class="c1 c38"><span class="c5">When we attune with others we allow our own internal state to shift, to come to resonate with the inner world of another. This resonance is at the heart of the important sense of &ldquo;feeling felt&rdquo; that emerges in close relationships. Children need attunement to feel secure and to develop well, and throughout our lives we ne</span><span class="c5">ed attunement to feel close and connected. (Siegel, 201</span><span class="c5">0, p. 27)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The assertion that connection is an essential part of the human condition is reiterated by many. &ldquo;Love and belonging might seem like a convenience we can live without, but our biology is built to thirst for connection because it is linked to our most basic survival needs&rdquo; (Lieberman, 2015, p. 43). In order to survive, humans must be connected.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Research on the value of connection in learning covers a broad range of perspectives on the student-educator relationship (Luvmour, 2006, 2010, 2011), the transformative value of learning within a community (Bandura, 1977) and </span><span>between abstract concept</span><span class="c0">s in transdisciplinary learning (Siemens, 2004). The development of a positive learner identity (discussed further below) can be influenced by the learner-instructor connection, &ldquo;integrating meaningful dialogue with children throughout daily activity is a great way to encourage a positive learner identity in the children we work with.&rdquo; (Hood, 2023a, para. 8). </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Inevitably, technology has influenced the discussion and the concept of networked learning has been defined as &ldquo;learning in which information and communications technology (ICT) is used to promote connections: between one learner and other learners, between learners and tutors; between a learning community and its learning resources&rdquo; (Goodyear et al., 2005, p. 453). The learner-learner connection is important because &ldquo;when people feel part of a group, they are motivated to establish a shared set of values and beliefs, and to coordinate their behaviour </span><span>to promote the interests of the group</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; (Bunce, 2021, para. 2). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Connectivism as a learning theory has been the subject of much discussion (Kop &amp; Hill, 2008). It is described as </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>the integration of principles explored by chaos, network, and complexity and self-organization theories. Learning is a process that occurs within nebulous environments of shifting core elements &ndash; not entirely under the control of the individual</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Siemens, 2005, p. 8). This research refers to the connection of concepts in a complex world. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The term &ldquo;connected learning,&rdquo; coined by Ito et al. (2012) &ldquo;advocates for broadened access to learning that is socially embedded, interest-driven, and oriented toward educational, economic, or political opportunity&rdquo; (</span><span>p. 4)</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;This theory of learning is connected to the concept of personalized learning in which the individual&rsquo;s journey is supported by the community in order for the learner to become a valuable contributor to the community. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">These concepts represent the three tenets of the DiG and the three domains of the Learner Identity (LID) survey. Learner identity is discussed below, along with the nine characteristics identified in the survey. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.m1wloqajke8d"><span class="c8">Learner Identity</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>The concept of learner identity is closely connected to narrative identity, &ldquo;a person&rsquo;s internalized and evolving life story, integrating the reconstructed past and imagined future to provide life with some degree of unity and purpose&rdquo; (McAdams &amp; McLean, 2013, p.</span><span>&nbsp;187</span><span>). According to Kolb and Kolb (2009), a learning identity lies at the heart of the &ldquo;learning way,&rdquo; a concept coined as part of their studies of experiential learning experiences. They go on to explain that </span><span>people with a &ldquo;learning identity</span><span>,&rdquo; &ldquo;see themselves as learners, seek and engage life experiences with a learning attitude, and believe in their ability to learn&rdquo; (Kolb &amp; Kolb, 2009, p.</span><span>&nbsp;5</span><span class="c0">). </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Learner identity is a dynamic aspect of an individual&rsquo;s self-concept as a learner; diverse learning experiences are integrated into this cohesive story of personal growth and evolution.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As a self-perception and understanding that develops over time, it encompasses the beliefs, attitudes, values, and experiences related to the process of acquiring knowledge and skills. Developing a learner identity involves recognizing one&rsquo;s strengths, preferences, challenges, and the strategies employed in the pursuit of learning. This identity can evolve over time based on educational experiences, feedback, and personal reflections.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In considering the formation of learner identity, educational experiences significantly contribute to the way that individuals interpret their learning journey, including successes, failures, and transformative moments. The learner identity also impacts how the experience becomes part of their broader life story. Positive and challenging learning experiences shape the narrative individuals tell themselves about who they are as learners. The development of a learner identity involves reflecting on personal values related to learning, such as the importance of curiosity, resilience, collaboration, or creativity. These values become integral elements of the narrative that individuals construct about their identities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Learner identity serves as a foundational element that underpins the whole narrative identity&ndash;influencing how individuals perceive their past, present, and future in the context of their learning experiences. The stories we tell ourselves about our learning journey contribute to a broader narrative that shapes our sense of self and purpose. Therefore, a survey to measure the values and skills of being a learner was created to support the students to self-assess the impact of the DiG on their learning during this study. </span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.x9fb4hufakbq"><span class="c8">Learner Identity Defined by LID Survey</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>For this thesis, learner identity is assessed by the </span><span>LID survey</span><span>&nbsp;originally co-created by Thompson Morrison, a software industry consultant, and Jessica Lewis, an educator in an inquiry-based school in Australia. Based upon the core tenets of the DiG, the three domains of the survey are </span><span>curiosity, courage and connectio</span><span class="c0">n. Within each domain, three characteristics are defined and respondents are asked to self-assess on a Likert-scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The LID survey was shared with the students before and after the four-week experience with the DiG. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The questions</span><span>&nbsp;asked in the pre- and post-surveys (Appendix A) and mid- and retro-</span><span>questionnaires</span><span>&nbsp;(Appendices B and C) are based on neuroscience and academic research that show that having a &ldquo;learning identity&rdquo; has an impact on the capacity of people to &ldquo;trust their direct personal experiences and their ability to learn from them&rdquo; (Kolb &amp; Kolb, 2009 p. 6). The DiG recognizes that &ldquo;learning changes the brain by forming new connections and that students are in charge of this process&rdquo; (Blackwell et al., 2007, </span><span>p. 254</span><span>). The researcher is curious about how the DiG impacts the development of this self-belief in the capacity to learn</span><span>. Each domain and characteristic used in the LID survey is explained below.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c30" id="h.1nno9neb2xnd"><span class="c24 c5">Curiosity</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Having a disposition of curiosity is important because it means learners can explore new ideas from a place of awe and wonder about the world; they can ask questions, and seek answers. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c36">Disposition.</span><span>&nbsp;A tentative definition of disposition is &ldquo;a tendency to exhibit frequently, consciously, and voluntarily a pattern of behavior that is directed to a broad goal,&rdquo; (Katz, 1993, p. 2). &nbsp;A learning disposition refers to the way in which learners engage in and relate to the learning process. It is sometimes called &ldquo;habits of mind&rdquo; or &ldquo;dispositions to learning,&rdquo; and is important because it affects how students approach learning and therefore the outcomes of their learning. Adopting the disposition of a &ldquo;</span><span>growth mindset</span><span>&rdquo; (Dweck, 2008) by overcoming obstacles, embracing successes, and navigating the complexities of learning contributes to the narrative of one&rsquo;s identity. Hedges (2021) stated that </span><span>&ldquo;dispositions assisted development of learning and early career identities&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(p. 189). For example, some desirable learning dispositions include resourcefulness, curiosity, and persistence. In summary, learning dispositions are important for building one&rsquo;s learner identity because they affect how learners approach learning and therefore the outcomes of their learning. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c36">Awe.</span><span>&nbsp;The experience of awe can be described as an &ldquo;epistemic emotion&rdquo; that can inspire learning within the student and has been defined as &ldquo;an emotional response to perceptually vast stimuli that overwhelm current mental structures, </span><span>yet facilitate attempts at accommodation</span><span>&rdquo; (Shiota et al., 2007, </span><span>p. 944</span><span>). This can lead to a greater sense of life purpose. This is connected to Piaget&#39;s schema (discussed on page 27) and the extended by Jones et al. (2002), &ldquo;In science education, awe has the potential to motivate explanation-seeking, promote conceptual change, and instill feelings of connectedness to the natural world&rdquo; (</span><span>p. 2485</span><span>)</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c36">Wonder.</span><span>&nbsp;Wonder is often thought to be related to awe. The Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley (2018) shared that wonder is </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>the response to something incomprehensible, incredible but not frightening, a rarely felt emotion</span><span>&rdquo; (</span><span>Ekman &amp; Cordaro, 2011, p. 365)</span><span>. &nbsp;An article titled, &ldquo;Wonder and Learning&rdquo; shares that &ldquo;Socrates said, &lsquo;Philosophy begins with wonder.&rsquo; Philosophy begins with the act of marveling and questionin</span><span>g&rdquo; (cited in McEwan, 2008, p. 109).</span><span>&nbsp;Philosophy, or making sense of the world, is an important part of learning (Darbor et al., 2016). Hadzigeorgiou (2020) shared, &ldquo;wonder can be an important teaching/learning tool, which can foster both emotional and cognitive engagement with subject matter, regardless of the discipline (e.g., history, science, geography, language arts)&rdquo; (p. 186). </span></p><h3 class="c1 c30" id="h.e3hvj7w1mymd"><span class="c24 c5">Courage </span></h3><p class="c28 c73"><span class="c0">The DiG is a participatory process, with each member of the group gently invited to contribute to the learning process. It is recognized that it takes confidence to share the learning in a group, which can make people feel vulnerable. The courage needed to share their learning journey leads to an increase in resilience. These concepts will be explored further here. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c36">Confidence.</span><span>&nbsp;Confident students are better able to perform under pressure and they have higher levels of resilience, allowing them to rebound from tough situations and get back on track. For students to have the confidence to push themselves out of their comfort zone to reach deeper learning, they need courage (Cengage, 2023). Having confidence is important for building one&rsquo;s learner identity because it helps students take risks, overcome challenges, and persist in the face of adversity. Norman and Hyland (2003) identified in their study that lack of confidence is a barrier to learning and that social interaction is a factor in increasing confidence. This is reinforced by a study that found out that &ldquo;students with self-confidence can lead them [to] improved participation, enjoy learning, reduced test anxiety, increased interest in goal seeking, growth of comfort with their lecturers and classmates and finally help them in sharing their experience and opinions in the class&rdquo; (Akbari &amp; Sahibzada, 2020, p. 15).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c36">Vulnerability. </span><span class="c0">Vulnerability is generally understood to be the state of being exposed to the possibility of harm or damage. However, being vulnerable is important for building one&rsquo;s learner identity because it helps learners develop a deeper understanding of themselves and their learning process. Robinson (2021) points out that although there are many reasons why engaging in authentic reflection practices is helpful for students and educators, there is a reluctance to do so because of the level of vulnerability required. Furthermore, being vulnerable in the classroom can lead to learning breakthroughs in students and create a community of people who care for one another. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Huddy (2015</span><span>) points out that many studies show that &ldquo;one of the most effective ways to build trust is through displaying emotional vulnerability and connecting human to human</span><span>&rdquo; (</span><span>p. 96</span><span>). Palmer (2017) states that it is important for educators to show up as vulnerable with their students, &ldquo;To reduce our vulnerability, we disconnect from students, from subjects, and even from ourselves. . . . We distance ourselves from students and subject to minimize the danger&mdash;forgetting that distance makes life more dangerous still by isolating the self&rdquo; </span><span>(p. 17-18).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c36">Resilience. </span><span>Resilience is generally understood as the ability to recover from setbacks, adapt to change, and keep going in the face of adversity, &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life experiences, especially through mental, emotional, and behavioral flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands</span><span class="c5">&rdquo; (APA). </span><span>G&uuml;ndo&#287;an (2023) shares various definitions of the concept of &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">psychological resilience&rdquo; (PR). It is defined as the competence to comply and improve in the face of an important risk situation (Masten &amp; Coatsworth, 1998). Coutu (2022) suggests that individuals with strong PR have three characteristics: &ldquo;a</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;robust belief that life is meaningful, acceptance of actuality, and the capability to improvise</span><span class="c5">&rdquo; (p. 5). PR enables individuals to produce an effective solution to problem situations faced in their daily lives. In addition, PR has a positive and supportive contribution to individuals&rsquo; making useful choices for themselves (Collins, 2008 as cited in </span><span>G&uuml;ndo&#287;an, 2023, p. 289</span><span class="c5">).</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Having resilience is important for building one&rsquo;s learner identity because it helps learners take risks, overcome challenges, and persist in the face of adversity.</span><span><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://positivepsychology.com/teaching-resilience/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1709861929598707&amp;usg=AOvVaw1T3Bf27j3Vy57F2djMP3Cp">&nbsp;</a></span></p><h3 class="c1 c30" id="h.qzlgaeeeojyh"><span class="c24 c5">Connection</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">By co-creating a culture of connectedness, educators can increase the engagement, trust and creativity in their classrooms. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c36">Engagement. </span><span>Student engagement is &ldquo;receiving much attention all over the world and underpins so many other priorities such as retention, widening participation and improving student learning generally&rdquo; (Bryson, 2014, abstract). Halverson and Graham (2019) differentiate between cognitive and emotional engagement. In general, engagement refers to the degree of involvement, interest, and enthusiasm that learners show toward their learning. Their study found that learner engagement correlates with important educational outcomes, including academic achievement, persistence, satisfaction, and sense of community.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c36">Trust. </span><span class="c0">One of the factors that can contribute to the development of a positive learner identity is trust. Landrum et al. (2015) have presented a theoretical framework that explains how &ldquo;the automatic psychological reasoning involved in trust and learning creates a dynamic process of social learning that evolves over time&rdquo; (p. 3). This acknowledges that there needs to be a relationship of trust between the student and the educator in order for the student to learn. As Cohn-Vargas and Steele (2015) point out, &ldquo;teacher warmth and availability for learning and positive student relationships [is] foundational for trust&rdquo; (section 3). </span></p><p class="c1 c38"><span class="c0">It is only through a sense of trust that students will embrace an empowering experience of freedom, and the exercise of this freedom requires a risk on behalf of students and their teacher. This is the experience and risk of having to face a world beyond absolutes, and yet live and learn in a meaningful way. (Curzon-Hobson, 2002, p. 266)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">This explanation of trust as it relates to learning also emphasizes the importance of the student-educator relationship and how trust is a foundational aspect of vulnerability; trusting the educators to provide appropriate support, guidance and feedback. One of the Agile principles states, &ldquo;Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done&rdquo; (Agile Manifesto, 2001, para 5). This illustrates the importance of trust in the process, an inclusive culture and trusting the people involved. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c36">Creativity. </span><span>One of the factors that can contribute to the development of a positive learner identity is creativity. Creativity is defined as &ldquo;not just taking in knowledge but doing something in the field,&rdquo; (Mehta, quoted in Mineo, 2019, para. 7</span><span>)</span><span class="c0">. It is the ability to generate novel and valuable ideas, products, or solutions using critical thinking skills (Mayer, 1989). Beghetto and Karwowski (2018), called for clarification of the relationship between creativity and learning and Karwowski et al. (2020) studied the relationship between academic achievement and creativity. There is general agreement that personalized learning is connected to creativity. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>There are many studies that have explored the impact of teaching, the learning environment and teacher ethos on the creativity of students implying that creativity can both be developed and is an innate quality within all of us </span><span>(as cited in Lin, 2011)</span><span>. In a study in which the teachers aimed to nurture and develop the creative potential of their learners through empowering them to make decisions for themselves about their own progress and learning directions, it was found that there was a positive effect on teacher confidence and capability</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c0">Davies, 2013).</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.yku2f9uso15q"><span class="c8">Conclusion</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This literature review provided an overview of the research as it relates to personalized learning, transformative learning and the latest neuroscience research on how we learn. The history of the DiG learning framework provided a context for the three tenets: curiosity, courage and connection. The LID survey characteristics, categorized under the three tenets of the DiG, have been researched and connected to learner identity. In the next chapter, the research methodology and methods will be defined and described. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c11" id="h.ixopqc7pezo7"><span>CHAPTER III: RESEARCH METHODS</span></h1><p class="c4"><span>The intention of this research study was</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to assess the impact of the Designed inGenuity Learning Framework on ninth- and tenth- grade students in an international school in Ethiopia. </span><span>I</span><span>mpact on learning, as a verb, is a subjective experience that is difficult to measure</span><span>, and therefore, the metric of learner identity, as defined above, has been adopted. </span><span class="c0">Changes in the nine characteristics of learner identity as named in the LID survey and a thematic analysis of the students&rsquo; and educators&rsquo; reflections will be used to identify the impact. The DiG learning framework, based on neuroscience and the psychological understanding of how we learn, guides students on a personalized, transformative and self-directing learning journey. Therefore, the results will be analyzed in the context of the three themes of Personalized Learning (PL), Transformative Learning (TL) and Self-Directed Learning (SDL). </span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.l7l5kk1j5tda"><span>Methodolog</span><span>y</span></h2><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A convergent </span><span>mixed-methods approach was used to collect </span><span>both quantitative and qualitative data.</span><span>&nbsp;This study uses convergent parallel design, taking qualitative and qualitative data collection and analysis and comparing or relating the two and then interpreting them. Younas et al. (2023) explain that integrating qualitative and quantitative methods, data, and findings is of utmost importance in mixed-methods research (MMR) and distinguishes MMR from monomethod research. This methodology was chosen because the researcher was curious about the consistency of the data. The strengths of this approach are that it is possible to test congruence in the study results and identify patterns across the data. The weaknesses of this approach are that it can be time consuming, tedious and the interpretation of the results can be biased. Areas of convergence or divergence between the qualitative and quantitative results will be discussed in the concluding chapter. </span></p><h3 class="c1 c30" id="h.2sg03iv97806"><span class="c24 c5">Population</span></h3><p class="c4"><span>All ninth- and tenth-grade students and educators who participated in the DiG were included in this study. There were 140 students from ages 14 to 16. There were 17 educators of whom 10 participated in their first DiG experience before guiding students through a DiG. However, n</span><span>o educators had guided students through a DiG before. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>This study was conducted at an urban Ethiopian school whose population can be described as students from international backgrounds, with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. </span><span>No specific data about age, gender and nationality was gathered from either the students or the educators.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c1 c30" id="h.8e9pp83s4bm9"><span>Ethical </span><span>Considerations</span></h3><p class="c12 c28"><span>This study was approved by Antioch University&rsquo;s Institutional Review Board </span><span>and i</span><span>nformed consent for all participants was obtained</span><span>, as per the Ethiopian Guidelines that &ldquo;research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, involving normal educational practices&rdquo; are exempt </span><span>(FDRE, 2014, p. 40)</span><span>.

Also, since the data was gathered anonymously, it was not possible to enforce a requirement on all students to complete all surveys and questionnaires.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c30" id="h.koycxcp627hn"><span class="c24 c5">Limitations</span></h3><p class="c12 c28"><span>This study had limitations that could impact the generalizability of the results. First, the study was conducted at the end of the school year, which led to a decrease in survey and questionnaire participation at the end of the experience; some students had already left school for the summer break. </span><span>During the experience, it emerged that there was a bias against PLEx from both </span><span>educators and students due to past negative experiences. Both parties shared that in the past there was a lack of structure and that the projects had little impact on the students or the world. A third l</span><span>imitation of the study was that only ten of the seventeen </span><span>educators </span><span>experienced the DiG as learners themselves. This impacted their ability to effectively guide the students through the framework process</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Finally, t</span><span>his study was only undertaken at one international school; the study may not be generalizable to other </span><span>international </span><span>schools. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>T</span><span>his research will inform future studies of the potential impact of the DiG</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>and the lessons learned from the limitations of this experience will inform future research.

The quantitative data was analyzed using a radar chart and the qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic analysis which revealed nine themes connected to personalized learning, transformative learning and self-directed learning. In addition, the educators shared nine themes from their own participation, observations and interactions in the DiG process and one recommendation. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span>The quantitative data gathered from the learner identity survey allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of the DiG framework in having an impact on learner identity. The key findings are that the framework had the greatest impact on students&rsquo; level of vulnerability (under the tenet of courage), defined as &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">I am willing to tell others when I feel worried about my learning or don&rsquo;t understand something.&rdquo; </span><span>This was closely followed by a positive change in the students&rsquo; disposition (under the tenet of curiosity) toward demonstrating excitement about learning new things. This was followed by a positive change in the students&rsquo; creativity (under the tenet of connection), defined as &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">I have creative ideas. I talk about my creative ideas and answers to problems. I love the opportunity to create.</span><span>&rdquo; These findings suggest that the DiG, as a personalized and transformative learning experience,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;leads us to becoming more comfortable with vulnerability while demonstrating a growth mindset and becoming more creative in our expression of new ideas and making new things.</span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span>The possibility that vulnerability will increase as a result of participating in a DiG is significant because it suggests the possibility for authentic reflection practices that move the learning forward for students. This form of courageous communication within the classroom can create a feeling of psychological safety and connection between educators and students that is conducive to deeper learning. The positive change in the disposition of the students suggests that the DiG is able to create the conditions for a &ldquo;growth mindset&rdquo; (Dweck, 2008). The process assumes that you are curious about something and are therefore willing to learn and extend your ideas about the world. The feeling of excitement increased for some students as a result of the DiG learning framework. In addition, according to the data, the DiG increased the students&rsquo; perception of themselves as creative learners. This is particularly significant as the DiG is presented as a framework for the creative mind. In summary, the quantitative data reflects how the DiG asks you to dig deeper into your own story, creating the opportunity for you to share any concerns or uncertainties about what is being learned and creates the opportunity to make connections between new concepts and ideas. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The thematic analysis of the qualitative data revealed that the DiG learning framework creates the conditions for a personalized, transformative and self-directed learning experience. </span><span class="c0">The data revealed the value of the DiG as a personalized learning process in which students choose what they learn about, develop skills and manage their own time. The experience of transformative learning was confirmed through students who were excited about the opportunities to be using a new approach to learning and creatively making things; affirming the findings of the quantitative data of a positive change in disposition and creativity. &nbsp;There is also evidence that making meaning through a new approach to learning that emphasized reflection led to self-discovery and deeper thinking. Finally, the data showed that the DiG created possibilities for self-directed learning in which students broadened their perspectives through unexpected discoveries and overcame challenges and complexity by talking them through with others; affirming the positive change in vulnerability in the quantitative data. These findings were reinforced by the educator insights and reflections.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Along with these findings, the question emerged, &ldquo;Why did the positive impact of the DiG on students&rsquo; learner identity not reach all the students to the same extent?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c31 c22 c29 c38"><span class="c0 c5">The idea of a personalized learning experience sounds amazing, especially considering how much our school system is based on such an old-school format, the same old content, and the same old assessment methods. The combination of students not taking this seriously for different reasons, not managing their time well, and the fact that PLEx was never executed well hasn&#39;t proved a good use for most students yet. </span></p><p class="c31 c29 c38 c48"><span class="c5">&ndash;A ninth- or tenth-grade student</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Using this reflection as a prompt, there is a need to evaluate both the impact of the framework and also the context in which the framework was introduced, the way in which it was presented and the impact of educator experience with the framework.</span></p><p class="c31 c12 c28"><span>The specific context of the school impacted the experience for the educators and the students. There is an active war in Ethiopia, leadership of the school had changed and some educators had recently joined or changed positions within the school, reflecting the dynamic nature of an international school. Change in school leadership impacts the culture of learning and teaching within the school and can create a high level of uncertainty and concern about what is being measured in terms of success. The educators who had recently joined the school mentioned needing time to understand the parental expectations of the experience. As mentioned in the quote, the students shared that their current experience of school and assessment is the same as those who have gone before. </span><span>This context impacted the learner identity of the educators, particularly in terms of their trust in the new process introduced by new leadership, their willingness to be vulnerable with students and their confidence in guiding the DiG.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>This study revealed that when introducing a new intervention into a school setting, it is essential that all stakeholders involved are fully informed of the expectations, the intention of the new method and details of the method itself. </span><span class="c0">The expectation of the four-week experience from the students and the educators influenced the internal validity of this study. This was most clearly demonstrated when students were asked about their expectations and they responded with, &ldquo;Chill time,&rdquo; particularly as it was the last four weeks of the school year after end of year exams. The educators shared that their expectations were for the students to independently work on their project, ideally in silence and without causing disruption to them or other students. In terms of student engagement with the learning process, expectations were low from both students and educators who had experienced PLEx before. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>However, the new leadership, including the Lead Facilitator, expected higher student engagement and that is why the DiG process was introduced. In addition, the level of deep learning expected by the Lead Facilitator was higher than other</span><span>&nbsp;stakeholders</span><span>. </span><span>The intention of introducing the DiG to the students was not clearly explained and therefore they were not prepared for the change in learning approach. Before beginning the DiG, b</span><span>oth students and educators shared that as grades were not attached to the experience, the significance of the experience was not fully recognized. </span><span class="c0">The expectations appeared to change as several months earlier, the students had been asked to share their final project idea. Therefore, when the DiG was introduced and it was explained that there would be a greater focus on the process of learning than the students&rsquo; final product, the students were surprised and continued to request &ldquo;more time for students to finish up their product correctly&rdquo; and wondering if they had &ldquo;passed.&rdquo; The timing of introducing the framework with different expectations had a significant impact on the students&rsquo; experience with the DiG. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The constraint of time also had a significant impact on the educators&rsquo; experience with the DiG. </span><span>Only 10 of the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>17 </span><span>guides were given time to participate in the week-long professional learning experience of the DiG. The educators who participated in the DiG </span><span>(DiGgers)</span><span>&nbsp;had clarity that the intention of the learning framework is to inspire deeper learning and were committed to doing so. </span><span>The educators who were </span><span class="c51">curious</span><span>&nbsp;about the process and voluntarily participated in the educator DiG shared that because they had </span><span class="c51">courageously</span><span>&nbsp;participated in a DiG themselves, they felt confident leading students through the process. In addition, they shared that they felt a strong sense of psychological safety and </span><span class="c51">connection</span><span>&nbsp;within the group, which gave them the confidence to experiment with the learning framework. They also felt a sense of agency to trust their intuition when guiding the students toward personalized and transformative learning. </span><span>This leads to the key finding that the impact of the DiG on the students&rsquo; learner identity was highly influenced by the learner identity of the educator leading the group. Educators who had participated in the DiG more confidently guided the students to follow their curiosities to authentic surprise, connecting seemingly disconnected concepts with their lived experience and </span><span>facilitated meaningful conversations that deepened and extended the learning.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>There was a clear disparity between educators that had experienced the DiG process and those that had not. For the</span><span>&nbsp;educators who had not experienced the DiG for themselves, this intervention lacked alignment and clarity, caused confusion and was challenging to understand. </span><span>They</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>repeatedly shared their uncertainty and insecurity about whether they were &ldquo;doing it right.&rdquo; </span><span>The lack of time made available for the educators to attend a parent gathering that explained the process and to meet each other during regular work hours to both plan for the process and share reflections at the end of the day had a significant impact on the student experience of the DiG. Although efforts were made by the Lead Facilitator to create alignment with the process through group gatherings and reflections, a meaningful understanding of the value of these was not achieved</span><span>. </span><span>This led to repetitive use of the Learning Questions (see Appendix G) with the students </span><span>and they detected an inauthenticity in its overuse.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This shows that it is essential for educators to have experienced the DiG for themselves before guiding students. </span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span class="c0">Intrinsically connected to the students&rsquo; sense of psychological safety was the educators&rsquo; feelings of the same and their willingness to be vulnerable with the students. The DiGgers who were willing to share their own experiences of the DiG anecdotally shared that their students were willing to be more vulnerable as a result. In addition, it appears that students who worked with educators who modeled a growth mindset by being willing to share that they did not know all of the answers and that in this work there is no one right answer, experienced a positive impact on their disposition. The educators who were willing to walk with the students through their creative journey, encouraging them to make decisions about their own progress and directions are likely to have had the greatest impact on the students&rsquo; perception of their own creativity. The importance of the educator modeling the characteristics of learner identity within the three tenets of the DiG is a possible area of further research. </span></p><p class="c12 c28"><span>As a result of this study, several ideas for future research have emerged to support the implementation of the DiG learning framework in schools. T</span><span>here are three d</span><span>istinct implications of the findings in this research: </span></p><ol class="c10 lst-kix_tqt8t74bijlf-0 start" start="1"><li class="c12 c33 c29 li-bullet-0"><span>The practice of learning and teachin</span><span class="c0">g: The adults&rsquo; perception of their role in relationship to the student has a significant impact on the students&rsquo; engagement with their learning journey. In order to guide students through a transformative learning experience that is led by their own interests, professional learning and teacher training needs to be reimagined toward deeper listening, the three tenets of the DiG and a focus on personalized learning.</span></li><li class="c12 c33 c29 li-bullet-0"><span>The introduction of interventions in schools</span><span class="c0">: It is essential to clearly explain the purpose of innovative practices to all stakeholders when bringing them into the learning environment. </span></li><li class="c12 c33 c29 li-bullet-0"><span>School and government policy regarding teacher workload in schools</span><span>: This work has the potential to influence educational policy in all contexts as it highlights the importance of prioritizing</span><span>&nbsp;time for reflective practices and receiving feedback. In addition, the study revealed the importance of educators receiving regular coaching to know how to guide student engagement with the process of learning as a creative endeavor.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol><h2 class="c31 c7" id="h.7z9nr9la83e9"><span class="c8">Final Thoughts</span></h2><p class="c31 c12 c28"><span>This study was inspired by the desire of an educator to create the conditions for personalized and transformative learning in a school setting.</span><span>&nbsp;The hypothesis was that introducing the DiG learning framework would have an impact on the students&rsquo; learner identity. The results show that the DiG had both positive and negative impacts. The discussion has explained that many factors contributed to these results. One key finding was that for educators to effectively guide students through a DiG </span><span>to </span><span>positively impact the students&rsquo; learner identity, they need to have experience of the DiG for themselves and for the learning framework to have had a positive impact on their own learner identity. The second key finding was that students need to repeatedly experience the DiG in order to experience a transformation in their perspective of personalized learning. The third key finding was related to the larger question about the role of educators in schools and a need to consider why they are essential to the students&rsquo; learning journey, who they are and what they are there to do. This question has overarching implications for the concept of learning and schools as places of learning. Going forward, the DiG learning framework requires further study in order to test these new hypotheses. </span></p><p class="c31 c12 c28"><span>Currently, the DiG learning framework is being used in elementary, inquiry-based schools in Queensland, Australia (Morrison &amp; Turner, 2021); State Middle Schools in Ohio, USA and a primary state school in Oxford, England. </span><span class="c0">This is the first formal study to explore the impact of the DiG on students and currently no papers or formal studies have been undertaken in any of these three locations. The practical implications of this research are multifold as it has been conducted in the context of the well-documented need for the transformation of education systems around the world. The complexity of the international, national and local school systems mean that there is no one solution to the problems that have been identified by many commentators. As the DiG is based on the Agile framework which is intrinsically an approach of adapting, pivoting and personalizing according to context, it may offer a path toward achieving the transformation desired. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c31 c12 c28"><span class="c0">In the context of a crisis of teacher retention around the world (Garc&iacute;a et al., 2023), the gap in research of the impact of the DiG on educators in terms of their connection with peers, educator learner identity and educator agency as a solution-seeker is the next planned study. The aspiration is to reframe the role of the adult in school from teacher to educator to coach to learning facilitator and, ultimately, guide so that the conditions are created for students to become creative learners who are empowered to seek sustainable solutions to the world&rsquo;s greatest challenges. The question that has emerged is, &ldquo;How might educators be inspired to create the conditions for purpose-driven learning in an ever-changing world?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c31 c12 c14"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c11 c37" id="h.3sfr8xb4kchc"><span class="c8"></span></h1><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c11 c37" id="h.rqxyh1k8xh3d"><span class="c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c30 c69" id="h.c5iiszr57ixd"><span>References</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>Agile Manifesto.
