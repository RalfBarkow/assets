9:42 AMEric DobbsDo you happen to have any collaborators from University of Colorado? Here's an org chart of CU's Office of Data Analytics which has done a lot of work with VIVO and other open data things.  https://www.colorado.edu/oda/sites/default/files/attached-files/oda_officialorgchart.pdf

9:52 AMLane Rasberryno, we do not have collaborators, but we have put data from our VIVO instance and other sources into Wikidata
9:53 AMLane Rasberrywith Pete I do newspapers, with my university I mostly do open citation metadata for academic publications, so VIVO and similar are key

10:48 AMOlaf BrugmanCommunities shape what people believe to a large extent. In my geo-environment, 50% of the population uses Whatsapp as its main news and information source. A large part of that uses it as its ONLY source. And that's where the fake news reigns. Would these people go to FedWiki sources?
