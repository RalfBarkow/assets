10:48 AM 	Olaf Brugman 	Communities shape what people believe to a large extent. In my geo-environment, 50% of the population uses Whatsapp as its main news and information source. A large part of that uses it as its ONLY source. And that's where the fake news reigns. Would these people go to FedWiki sources?
