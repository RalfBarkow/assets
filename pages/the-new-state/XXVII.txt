THE NEW STATEBy Mary Parker FollettThe Neighborhood Group:Chapter XXVIIFrom Neighborhood to Nation: The Unifying StateHOW can the will of the people be the sovereign power of the state?There must be two changes in our state: first, the state must bethe actual integration of living, local groups, thereby findingways of dealing directly with its individual members. Secondly,other groups than neighborhood groups must be represented in thestate: the ever-increasing multiple group life of today must berecognized and given a responsible place in politics [1].     1. This point will be taken up in ch. XXXIII.  First, every neighborhood must be organized; the neighborhoodgroups must then be integrated, through larger intermediary groups,into a true state. Neither our cities nor our states can ever beproperly administered until representatives from neighborhoodgroups meet to discuss and thereby to correlate the needs of allparts of the city, of all parts of the state.  Social workers andmedical experts have a conference on tuberculosis, social workersand educational experts have a conference on industrial education. We must now develop the methods by which the citizens also arerepresented at these conferences. We must go beyond this (forcertain organizations, as the National Settlement Conference atleast, do already have neighborhood representation), and developthe methods by which regular meetings of representatives fromneighborhood organizations meet to discuss all city and stateproblems.  Further still, we must give official recognition to suchgatherings, we must make them a regular part of government.  Theneighborhood must be actually, not theoretically, an integral partof city, of state, of nation.  When Massachusetts is thus organized, the neighborhood groups andintermediary, or district, groups should send representatives tocity council and state legislature. The Senate might be composed ofexperts -- experts in education, in housing, in sanitation etc.[1]. The neighborhood and district centres would receive reportsfrom their representatives to city council and state legislatureand take measures on these reports.  They should also be requiredto send regular reports up to their representative bodies. Weshould have a definitely organized and strongly articulated networkof personal interest and representative reporting.  Then the statelegislature must devise ways of dealing not only with the districtgroup but with the neighborhood groups through the district group,and thus with every individual in the commonwealth. The nation toomust have a real connection with every little neighborhood centrethrough state and district bodies [2].     1. Or perhaps the Senate might represent the occupational     group (see ch. XXXIII). Or perhaps the experts mentioned above     might be representatives from occupational groups.     2. In North Carolina the recently organized State Bureau of     Community Service -- made up of the administrators of the     Department of Agriculture, the Board of Health, the Normal and     Industrial College and the Farmers' Union, with the State     Superintendent of Public Instruction as its central executive     -- is making its immediate work the development of local     community organization which shall be directly articulated     with a unified state organization.  America at war has found a way of getting word from Washington tothe smallest local units.  The Council of National Defense has a"Section of Cooperation with States."  This is connected with aState Council of Defense in every state. In most cases the StateCouncil is connected with County Councils, and these often withcouncils in cities and towns.  Beyond this the Council of NationalDefense has recently (February, 1918) recommended the extension ofcounty organization by the creation of Community Councils in everyschool district.  Its official statement opens with this sentence:"The first nine months of the war have shown the vital importanceof developing an official nationwide organization reaching into thesmallest communities to mobilize and make available the efforts ofthe whole people for the prosecution of the war." And it goes on tosay that the government must have such close contact with smallunits that personal relation with all the citizens is possible.  President Wilson in endorsing this step, said, "[This is an]advance of vital significance.  It will, I believe, result whenthoroughly carried out in welding the nation together as no nationof great size has ever been welded before. . . . It is only byextending your organization to small communities that every citizenof the state can be reached."  Thus when the government found that it must provide means to itshands for keeping constantly in touch with the whole membership ofthe nation, it planned to do this by the encouragement andfostering of neighborhood organization.  The nation is now seekingthe individual through neighborhood groups.  It is using the SchoolCentres (it recommends the schoolhouse as the best centre forcommunity organization) for the teaching of Food and FuelConservation, for Liberty Loan and Red Cross work, for recruitingfor the army, for enlisting workers for war industries, forteaching the necessity and methods of increasing the food supply,for plans to relieve transportation by cooperative shipments anddeliveries, for patriotic education etc. [1].  This "patrioticeducation" has an interesting side.  In a country which is evennominally a democracy you cannot win a war without explaining youraims and your policy and carrying your people with you step bystep. If beyond this the country wishes to be really a democracy,the neighborhood groups must have a share in forming the aims andthe policy.  Of course one would always prefer this to be a movement frombelow up rather than from above down, but it is not impossible forthe two movements to go on at the same time, as they are in factdoing now with the rapid development of spontaneous localorganization.  There were Community Councils in existence in factif not in name before the recommendation of the Council of NationalDefense [2].     1. The Community Council, however, is not to duplicate other     organizations but first to coordinate all existing agencies     before planning new activities.     2. And spontaneously many towns and villages turned to the     school-house as the natural centre of its war services.  Through these non-partisan councils not only national policy canbe explained and spread throughout the country, but also what onelocality thinks out that is good can be reported to Washington andthus handed on to other sections of the country.  It is a plan forsending the news backwards and forwards from individual to nation,from nation to individual, and it is also a plan for correlatingthe problems of the local community with the problems of the nationand of cooperating nations.  But why should we be more efficiently organized for war than forpeace?  Is our proverbial carelessness to be pricked intoeffectiveness only by emergency calls? Is the only motive you canoffer us for efficiency -- to win? Or, if that is an instinctivedesire, can we not change the goal and be as eager to win otherthings as war?  I speak of the new state as resting upon integrated neighborhoodgroups [1].  While the changes necessary to bring this about wouldhave to be planned and authorized by constitutional conventions,its psychological basis would be: (1) the fact that we are readyfor membership in a larger group only by experience first in thesmaller group, and (2) the natural tendency for a real group toseek other groups. Let us look at this second point.     1. For the moment I ignore the occupational group to be     considered later.  We have seen the process of the single group evolving. Butcontemporaneously a thousand other unities are a-making. Everygroup once become conscious of itself instinctively seeks othergroups with which to unite to form a larger whole. Alone it cannotbe effective. As individual progress depends upon the degree ofinterpenetration, so group progress depends upon theinterpenetration of group and group.  For convenience I speak ofeach group as a whole, but from a philosophical point of view thereis no whole, only an infinite striving for wholeness, only the_principle_ of wholeness forever leading us on.  This is the social law: the law which connects neighborhood withneighborhood.  The reason we want neighborhood organization is notto keep people within their neighborhoods but to get them out. Themovement for neighborhood organization is a deliberate effort toget people to identify themselves actually, not sentimentally, witha larger and larger collective unit than the neighborhood. We maybe able through our neighborhood group to learn the social process,to learn to evolve the social will, but the question before us iswhether we have enough political genius to apply this method tocity organization, national organization, and internationalorganization. City must join with city, state with state, actually,not through party. Finally nation must join with nation.  The recommendation of the Council of National Defense which hasbeen mentioned above would repay careful reading for theindications which one finds in it of the double purpose ofneighborhood organization.  It is definitely stated that theimportance of the Community Council is in: (1) initiating work tomeet its own war needs; and (2) in making all its local resourcesavailable for the nation. And again it is stated that: (1) in ademocracy local emergencies can best be met by local action; and(2) that each local district should feel the duty of bearing itsfull share of the national burden.  Thus our national government clearly sees and specifically statesthat neighborhood organization is both for the neighborhood and forthe nation: that it looks in, it looks out. Thus that which we arecoming to understand as the true social process receives practicalrecognition in government policy.  I have said that neighborhood must join with neighborhood to formthe state. This joining of neighborhood and neighborhood can bedone neither directly nor imaginatively. It cannot be donedirectly: representation is necessary not only because the numberswould be too great for all neighborhoods to meet together, butbecause even if it were physically possible we should have createda crowd not a society. Theoretically when you have large numbersyou get a big, composite consciousness made up of infinite kinds offitting together of infinite kinds of individuals, but practicallythis varied and multiplied fitting together is not possible beyonda certain number. There must be representatives from the smallestunits to the larger and larger, up to the federal state.  Secondly, neighborhoods cannot join with neighborhoods throughthe imagination alone. Various people have asserted that now wehave large cities and solidarity cannot come by actualacquaintance, it must be got by appropriate appeals to theimagination, by having, for instance, courses of lectures to tellone part of a city about another part. But this alone will never besuccessful. Real solidarity will never be accomplished except bybeginning somewhere the joining of one small group with another. Weare told too that the uneducated man cannot think beyond hisparticular section of the universe. We can teach him to thinkbeyond his particular section of the universe by actually makinghim participate in other sections through connecting his sectionwith others. We are capable of being faithful to large groups aswell as small, to complex groups as well as simple, to our city, toour nation, but this can be effected only by a certain process, andthat process, while it may begin by a stimulation of theimagination, must, if it is going to bring forth results in reallife, be a matter of actual experience. Only by actual union, notby appeals to the imagination, can the various and variedneighborhood groups be made the constituents of a sound, normal,unpartisan city life. Then being a member of a neighborhood groupwill mean at the same time being a member and a responsible memberof the state.  I have spoken of the psychological tendency for group to seekgroup. Moreover, it is not possible to isolate yourself in yourlocal group because few local needs can be met without joining withother localities, which have these same needs, in order to securecity or state action. We cannot get municipal regulation for thedance-hall in our neighborhood without joining with otherneighborhoods which want the same thing and securing municipalregulation for all city dance-halls. If we want better housinglaws, grants for industrial education, we join with other groupswho want these things and become the state. And even if some needseems purely local, the method of satisfying it ought not to be forthe South End to pull as hard as it can for a new ward building,say, while the North End is also pulling as hard as it can for anew ward building, and the winner of such tug-of-war to get theappropriation. If the South End wants a new ward building it shouldunderstand how much money is available for ward buildings, and ifonly enough for one this year, consider where it is most needed. Probably, whatever the evidence, it will be decided that it is mostneeded in the South End, but a step will be taken towards adifferent kind of decision in the future.  And we join not only to secure city and state but also federalaction. If we want a river or harbor appropriation, we go toCongress. And if such demands are supplied at present on thelog-rolling basis, we can only hope that this will not always beso. When group organization has vitalized our whole political life,there may then be some chance that log-rolling will be repudiated.  And we do not stop even at Washington. Immigration is a nationaland international problem, but the immigrant may live next door toyou, and thus the immigration question becomes one of nearestconcern. This intricate interweaving of our life allows no man tolive to himself or to his neighborhood.  Then when neighborhood joins with neighborhood all the lessonslearned in the simple group must be practiced in the complex one.As the group lesson includes not only my responsibility _to_ mygroup but my responsibility _for_ my group, so I learn not only myduty to my neighborhood but that I am responsible for myneighborhood. Also it is seen that as the individuals of a groupare interdependent, so the various groups are interdependent, andthe problem is to understand just in what way they areinterdependent and how they can be adjusted to one another. Theprocess of the joining of several groups into a larger whole isexactly the same as the joining of individuals to form a group --a reciprocal interaction and correlation.  The usual notion is that our neighborhood association is toevolve an idea, a plan, and then when we go to represent it at ameeting of neighborhood associations from different parts of thecity that we are to try to push through the plan of action decidedon by our own local group. If we do not do this, we are notsupposed to be loyal. But we are certainly to do nothing of thekind. We are to try to evolve the collective idea which shallrepresent the new group, that is, the various neighborhoodassociations all acting together. We are told that we must notsacrifice the interests of the particular group we represent. No,but also we must not. try to make its interests prevail againstthose of others. Its real interests are the interests of the whole.  And then when we have learned to be truly citizens of Boston, wemust discover how Boston and other cities, how cities and the ruralcommunities can join. And so on and so on. At last the "real" stateappears. We are pragmatists because we do not want to unite withthe state imaginatively, we want to be the state; we want toactualize and feel our way every moment, let every group open theway for a larger group, let every circumference become the centreof a new circumference. My neighborhood group opens the path to theState.  But neighborhoods cooperating actively with the city governmentis not to-day a dream. Marcus M. Marks, President of the Borough ofManhattan, New York City, in 1914 divided Manhattan into sixteenneighborhoods, and appointed for each a neighborhood commissioncomposed of business men, professional men, mechanics, clerks etc.-- a thoroughly representative body chosen irrespective of partylines. Mr. Marks' avowed object was to obtain a knowledge of theneeds of his constituents, to form connecting links betweenneighborhoods and the city government. And these bodies need notexist dormant until their advice is asked. Sections 1 and 2 of theRules and Regulations read:     "1. The Commissions shall recommend, or suggest, to the          Borough President, for his consideration and advice,          matters which, in their opinion will be of benefit to          their districts and to the City.     "2. The Commissions shall receive from the Borough President          suggestions or recommendations for their consideration as          to matters affecting their districts, and report back          their conclusions with respect thereto."  Moreover, beyond the recommendations of the Commission, thecooperation of the whole neighborhood is sought. "Whenever thecommissions are in doubt as to the policy they desire to advocateand wish to further sound the sentiment of their localities,meetings similar to town-meetings are held, usually in the localschoolhouse."  The "neighborhoods" of Manhattan have cooperatedwith the city government in such matters as bus franchise, markets,location of tracks, floating baths, pavement construction, sewerageetc.  One of the results of this plan, Mr. Marks tells us, is thatmany types of improvement which were formerly opposed, such assewerage construction by the owners of abutting property, nowreceive the support of the citizens because there is opportunityfor them to understand fully the needs of the situation and even toemploy their own expert if they wish.  The chairmen of the twelve Neighborhood Commissions form a bodycalled the Manhattan Commission. This meets to confer with thePresident on matters affecting the interests of the entire borough[1].     1. I have taken this account from the official report.  I have     been told by New York people that these commissions have shown     few signs of life. This does not, however, seem to me to     detract from the value of the plan as a suggestion, or as     indication of what is seen to be advisable if not yet wholly     practicable. The New York charter provides for Local     Improvement Boards as connecting links with the central     government, hut these I am told have shown no life whatever.  This plan, while not yet ideal, particularly in so far as thecommissions are appointed from above, is most interesting to allthose who are looking towards neighborhood organization as thebasis of the new state.  To summarize: neighborhood groups join with other neighborhoodgroups to form the city -- then only shall we understand what it isto be the city; neighborhood groups join with other neighborhoodgroups to form the state -- then only shall we understand what itis to be the state. We do not begin with a unified state whichdelegates authority; we begin with the neighborhood group andcreate the state ourselves. Thus is the state built up through theintimate intertwining of all.  But this is not a crude and external federalism. We have nottransferred the unit of democracy from the individual to the group.It is the individual man who' must feel himself the unit of citygovernment, of state government: he has not delegated hisresponsibility to his neighborhood group; he has direct relationwith larger wholes. I have no medieval idea of mediatearticulation, of individuals forming groups and groups forming thenation.  Mechanical federalism we have long outgrown. The membersof the nation are to be individuals, not groups. The movement forneighborhood organization is from one point of view a movement togive the individual political effectiveness -- it is anindividualistic not a collectivistic movement, paradoxical as thismay seem to superficial thinking. But, as the whole structure ofgovernment must rest on the individual, it must have its rootswithin that place where you can get nearest to him, and where hislatent powers can best be freed and actualized -- his local group.  What are we ultimately seeking through neighborhood organization?To find the individual. But let no one think that the movement forneighborhood organization is a new movement. Our neighborhoodorganization, we are often told, had its origin in the New Englandtown-meeting. Yes, and far beyond that in the early institutions ofour English ancestors. That our national life must be grounded inthe daily, intimate life of all men is the teaching of the wholelong stream of English history.  We have seen that the increasing activity of the state, itssocial policies and social legislation, demands the activity ofevery man. We have seen in considering direct government that theactivity of every man is not enough if we mean merely his activityat the polling booths. With the inclusion of all men and women(practically accomplished) in the suffrage, with the rapidlyincreasing acceptance of direct government, the _extensive_ work ofthe democratic impulse has ended. Now the _intensive_ work ofdemocracy must begin. The great historic task of the Anglo-Saxonpeople has been to find wise and reasoned forms for the expressionof individual responsibility, has been so to bulwark the rights ofthe individual as to provide at the same time for the unity andstability of the state. They have done this externally by makingthe machinery of representative government. We want to-day to do itspiritually, to direct the spiritual currents in their flow andinterflow so that we have not only the external interpenetration --choosing representatives etc. -- but the deeper interpenetrationwhich shows the minds and needs and wants of all men.  We can satisfy our wants only by a genuine union and communion ofall, only in the friendly outpouring of heart to heart. We havecome to the time when we see that the machinery of government canbe useful to us only so far as it is a living thing: the souls ofmen are the stones of Heaven, the life of every man must contributefundamentally to the growth of the state. So the world spirit seeksfreedom and finds it in a more and more perfect union of trueindividuals.  _The relation of neighbors one to another must beintegrated into the substance of the state_. Politics must takedemocracy from its external expression of representation to theexpression of that inner meaning hidden in the intermingling of allmen. This is our part to-day- - thus shall we take our place in thegreat task of our race. Our political life began in the smallgroup, but it has taken us long to evolve our relation to anational life, and meanwhile much of the significance and richnessof the local fife has been lost. Back now to the local unit we mustgo with all that we have accumulated, to find in and through thatour complete realization.  Back we must go to this small primaryunit if we would understand the meaning of democracy, if we wouldget the fruits of democracy. As Voltaire said, "The spirit ofFrance is the candle of Europe," so must the spirit of theneighborhood be the candle of the nation.
