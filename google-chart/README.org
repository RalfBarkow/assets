1) Make a new directory called google-chart and open it in a terminal.
2) Run `elm init` and enter `y` when prompted. This will create a file called elm.json, which Elm needs to build our project. 
3) `elm init` will have created a directory called src. Create a file called Main.elm inside this src directory.
